------------------------


18)EnableAutoConfiguration- It is used to perform auto configuration  i.e, default configuration.

19)SpringBootApplication- It is the combination of componentscan, configuration and 
			enableautoconfiguration annotations. This annotation is used in application class(main class) 
				while setting up a spring boot project in its base package.


======================================================================================================

REST Annotations:
------------------------

20)RestController- Use to create restful WebServices and also takes care of mapping request data to the
						defined request 
						handler method.

	            It acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE).

27)ExceptionHandler- This annotation is used at method levels to handle exception at the controller level.

28)ResponseStatus- It marks a method or exception class with a status code and a reason that must be returned.
		It set the status code of an HTTP response.

29)ControllerAdvice- It allows you to handle exceptions across the whole application in one global handling component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angular Notes:
-------------------------			html+css+ts
39)subscribe-it is method on observable type.

40)obervable-it is a utility that asynchronously or synchronously stream data to a variety of componenets or services.

41)Angular -AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.
AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML.

42)Ng class-The ng-class Directive in AngularJS is used to specify the CSS classes on HTML elements. It is used to dynamically bind classes on an HTML element.

43)Ng style-It is used for styling html pages(just like css).

44)Data binding-it is a proess that establishes a connection b/w the app user inteface and the data it displays/automatic synchronization of data b/w model and view.

45)Authentication-user has to validate with user if the given username or Id is correct.
already a person who has access and can modify the access and transfer the authorization.

46)Authorization- unique id is provided to login(giving permission to autorization).

47)Metadata- it is data with in data(metadata to class to tell angular that my component is a component).

48)ng model-it is a directive that binds the values of html control like input,select,text area to application data.

49) two way data binding-the data goes both ways if the user changes the value inside the input filed the angular js properties will also change.created by ng model.{{}}.

50) Angular 6-Angular 6 is a JavaScript framework for building web applications and apps in JavaScript, html, and TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript.

51)Component-Components are like the basic building block in an Angular application. Components are defined using the @component decorator. A component has a selector , template , style and other properties, using which it specifies the metadata required to process the component.

52)Selector-The selector is a property inside the angular component which identifies the directive in a template and triggers instantiation of the directive.

53)decorators-Decorators are a design pattern that is used to separate modification or decoration of a class without modifying the original source code.

54)derectives-A directive allows you to attach a behavior to DOM elements. This behavior could be as simple or as complex as you'd like. *ngFor and *ngIf .

55)DOM-The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

56) ng content-You use the <ng-content></ng-content> tag as a placeholder for that dynamic content, then when the template is parsed Angular will replace that placeholder tag with your content . 

57)client certificate-A client side certificate is a certificate you use to establish your server to the client. This is the best way for the server to "know" exactly who is connecting to it.

58)constructor-A constructor is a special method which will be called whenever we create new objects. And generally used of initializing the class members.

59)ngOnInit-ngOnInit is a life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the component.It is a predefined method in a TypeScript class which is called when the class is instantiated.

60)Service-Services in Angular allow you to define code that's accessible and reusable throughout multiple components. A common use case for services is when you need to communicate with a backend of some sort to send and receive data.

61)Routing-AngularJS routes enable you to create different URLs for different content in your application. AngularJS routes allow one to show multiple contents depending on which route is chosen.

62)pipes-It takes integers, strings, arrays, and date as input separated with | to be converted in the format as required and display the same in the browser.

63)http service-Http Service will help us fetch external data, post to it, etc. We need to import the http module to make use of the http service.
import { HttpClientModule }    from '@angular/common/http';
http client-it is pre defined service. 

64)Directives in Angular is a js class, which is declared as @directive. We have 3 directives in Angular. The directives are listed below −

Component Directives
These form the main class having details of how the component should be processed, instantiated and used at runtime.

Structural Directives
A structure directive basically deals with manipulating the dom elements. Structural directives have a * sign before the directive. For example, *ngIf and *ngFor.

Attribute Directives
Attribute directives deal with changing the look and behavior of the dom element. You can create your own directives as shown below.

65)Event Binding-When a user interacts with an application in the form of a keyboard movement, a mouse click, or a mouseover, it generates an event. 
These events need to be handled to perform some kind of action. This is where event binding comes into picture.

66)Module-Module in Angular refers to a place where you can group the components, directives, pipes, and services, which are related to the application.

67)component-Components are basically classes that interact with the .html file of the component, which gets displayed on the browser.

68) form-With a template driven form, most of the work is done in the template; and with the model driven form, most of the work is done in the component class.

69)Angular Cli-Angular CLI makes it easy to start with any Angular project. Angular CLI comes with commands that help us create and start on our project very fast. 

-->impot-enables an Angular module to use functionality that was defined in another Angular module. 

-->Grouping in CSS is a technique used to reduce code redundancy and write clean, concise easy to follow code

-->components types
--app.component.css
--app.component.html
--app.component.ts

-->Scope of variable-Scope refers to the visibility of variables.
 In other words, which parts of your program can see or use it. Normally, every variable has a global scope. Once defined, 
every part of your program can access a variable.
inside function it is local and outside the function it is gloabal.

Transpile TypeScript into JavaScript
Step 1: Create a simple TS file. Open VS Code on an empty folder and create a helloworld. ...
Step 2: Run the TypeScript build. Execute Run Build Task (Ctrl+Shift+B) from the global Terminal menu. ...
Step 3: Make the TypeScript Build the default. ...
Step 4: Reviewing build issues.

difference b/w override and inheritance-override fucationality changes but doesnot change in inheritance


SpringBoot
-----------
70)Exceptional Handling-An exception is a problem that arises during execution of program.
So at that time the msg is given in system format.Inorder to give a user defined msg for that problem we handle that exception.

71)Jpa-it allows us to acccess and persist data b/w data objects.

72)Microservices-it is a architectural desgin style which decomposes larger applications into samller services and make communicaion b/w them.
every microservice are selfcontained.

73)SpringBoot-monolithic,it is a open source java based frame work used to  create microdservices.helps to avoid code configuration. it is used to build standalone and production ready spring applications.

c)starters
d)actuators.

74)DataBase-A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data.

75)Anonymous fuction in typescript-doesnot have name of the function but it has the functionality.
